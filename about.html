                        <h2>About Techung</h2>
                        <p>Techung is a prominent Tibetan singer/songwriter living in exile in the Adirondacks, New York. He is best known for his performances of traditional Tibetan music, dance and opera under the name Tashi Dhondup Sharzur. However, he uses his childhood nickname, Techung, when performing as a solo artist. Whether performing in traditional or contemporary styles, his dual goals are to revive Tibetan music in the Tibetan community and to expose the rich performing cultural tradition of his homeland to the world community.</p>

                        <h2>Early Life & Training</h2>
                        <p>Techung grew up in Dharamsala, India where his family was forced to resettle in India along with tens of thousands of other Tibetans after the Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1949. Because of the limited educational opportunities open to young refugees in the 1970s, he was enrolled at the age of nine in the newly formed Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts (TIPA), despite his family not having an artistic background.</p>
                        <p>In his seventeen years of residency at the Institute, he studied all aspects of the Tibetan performing arts - folk, court, and religious music traditions - through the oral teaching tradition used by the venerated Tibetan elders with whom he was honored to study. He toured with TIPA in its first international tour as a leading child actor in 1975-76 and for many years afterwards.</p>
